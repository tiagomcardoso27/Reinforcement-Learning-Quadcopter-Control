# Reinforcement-Learning-Quadcopter-Control
Designing and training of an agent to fly a quadcopter, using reinforcement learning. This project was a coursework in 
Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. A substantial part of the code was provided by Udacity, but the implementation
of flying tasks, the optimization of the algortithm's performance, calibration of parameters, designing of the reward function
etc. were all part of the assignments.

# Built with
The code was implemented in Python 3.

# Installation
To run it, you must have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
